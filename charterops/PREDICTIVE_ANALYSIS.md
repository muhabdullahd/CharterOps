# Predictive Disruption Analysis

## Overview

The Predictive Disruption Analysis feature uses AI to analyze historical flight data, weather patterns, crew schedules, and maintenance records to predict potential disruptions before they happen. This proactive approach helps charter operators minimize delays and improve operational efficiency.

## Features

### üéØ **Risk Scoring System**
- **Multi-factor Analysis**: Combines weather, crew, mechanical, airport, and historical data
- **Weighted Risk Calculation**: Each factor has a specific weight based on its impact
- **Risk Levels**: Low (0-39%), Medium (40-59%), High (60-79%), Critical (80%+)

### üìä **Prediction Factors**

1. **Weather Risk (25% weight)**
   - Temperature extremes
   - Wind speed analysis
   - Visibility conditions
   - Precipitation probability
   - Turbulence levels

2. **Crew Risk (20% weight)**
   - Duty hour compliance
   - Rest period violations
   - Crew availability
   - Qualification requirements

3. **Mechanical Risk (25% weight)**
   - Recent maintenance issues
   - Aircraft reliability history
   - Component wear patterns
   - Inspection schedules

4. **Airport Risk (15% weight)**
   - NOTAM restrictions
   - Runway availability
   - Ground handling capacity
   - Local weather conditions

5. **Historical Risk (15% weight)**
   - Past disruption patterns
   - Route-specific issues
   - Seasonal trends
   - Aircraft-specific problems

### üéØ **Confidence Scoring**
- **Data Quality Assessment**: Evaluates the reliability of available data
- **Factor Consistency**: Measures agreement between different risk factors
- **Confidence Range**: 30-95% based on data completeness and consistency

### ‚è∞ **Time Prediction**
- **Critical Risk**: 2 hours before departure
- **High Risk**: 4 hours before departure
- **Medium Risk**: 6 hours before departure
- **Low Risk**: 12 hours before departure

## How It Works

### 1. Data Collection
The system continuously monitors:
- Flight schedules and status
- Crew duty records and compliance
- Weather forecasts and conditions
- Maintenance logs and alerts
- Historical disruption patterns

### 2. Risk Analysis
For each upcoming flight, the AI engine:
- Analyzes historical data for similar flights
- Evaluates current conditions and forecasts
- Calculates weighted risk scores for each factor
- Determines the most likely disruption type
- Predicts when the disruption might occur

### 3. Recommendation Generation
Based on the analysis, the system provides:
- Specific action items for each risk factor
- Prioritized recommendations based on risk level
- Alternative solutions and contingency plans
- Timeline for implementing preventive measures
